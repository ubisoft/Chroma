## Known Issue During CMake Process
If you encounter the following error while running CMake without Visual Studio 2022:

```
error C2039: 'wait_for': is not a member of 'winrt::impl'
```

This issue may occur due to an outdated `CPPWinRT` library. To resolve it, install the `Microsoft.Windows.CppWinRT` NuGet package using the following command:

```sh
nuget install Microsoft.Windows.CppWinRT
```

Alternatively, ensure that your development environment is using an updated version of `CPPWinRT`. **The best option to avoid this issue is to use Visual Studio 2022.**
